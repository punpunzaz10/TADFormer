## Installation

To get started with TADFormer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/punpunzaz10/TADFormer.git
   cd TADFormer
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the necessary datasets and models. You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/punpunzaz10/TADFormer/releases).

## Usage

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

Replace `config.yaml` with your desired configuration file. You can modify this file to adjust parameters for your specific tasks.

To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model.pth
```
